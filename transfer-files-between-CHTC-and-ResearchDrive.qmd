## The Long Game

The goal being this project is to document the submission process of an R project to CHTC. The main motivation is to lower *the barrier to entry* to CHTC by automating several of the steps involved in a job submission to CHTC. It is well known (citations?) that the command line constitutes a painpoint for many researchers that keeps them from leveraging the compute resources offered by CHTC.

This workflow details the steps involved in the process of transferring data from ResearchDrive to the CHTC systems, and from the CHTC systems back into Research Drive. It assumes:

- You have access to a ResearchDrive Share (as either a PI, or member of a PI's group).
- You have an existing account with CHTC.

## Transfering Files

### Log in:

If you are are transferring to a `/staging` directory, log in to `transfer.chtc.wisc.edu`.

If you are transferring files and or from your `/home` directory, log into your usual submit server.

- HTC Servers will be `ap2001.chtc.wisc.edu` or `ap2002.chtc.wisc.edu`.
- HPC Servers will be _______________

### Choose a folder in your CHTC Directory to transfer into:

Navigate to the folder in CHTC (`/staging` or `/home`), into which you would like to transfer files.

### Connect ResearchDrive:

Run the following command to connect to ResearchDrive, filling in the username of your PI:

`$ smbclient -k //research.drive.wisc.edu/PI-Name`

Your prompt should change to look like this:

`smb: \> `

### Choose a folder in your Research Drive Directory to transfer from:

If you type `ls` now, youâ€™ll see the files in ResearchDrive, not CHTC. Navigate through ResearchDrive (using `cd`) until you are at the folder where you would like to get or put files.

### Move files:

To move individual files, you will use the `get` and `put` commands.

- To move a file from CHTC to ResearchDrive, run: `smb: \> put filename`

- To move a file from ResearchDrive to CHTC, run: `smb: \> get filename`

To move multiple files, you will use `mget` and `mput` commands.

- To move files from CHTC to ResearchDrive, run: `smb: \> mput *.csv`

- To move files from ResearchDrive to CHTC, run: `smb: \> mget *.csv`

### Finish:

Once you are done moving files, you can type `exit` to disconnect from ResearchDrive.
